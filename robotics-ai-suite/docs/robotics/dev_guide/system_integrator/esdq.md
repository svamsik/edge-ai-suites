# Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ)) for Autonomous Mobile Robot

## Overview

Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® Edge Software Device
Qualification (Intel® ESDQ)) for Autonomous Mobile Robot provides
customers with the capability to run an Intel-provided test suite at the
target system, with the goal of enabling partners to determine their
platform's compatibility with the Autonomous Mobile Robot.

The target of this self certification suite is the Autonomous Mobile
Robot compute systems. These platforms are the brain of the Robot Kit.
They are responsible to get input from sensors, analyze them, and give
instructions to the motors and wheels to move the Autonomous Mobile
Robot.

## How It Works

The Autonomous Mobile Robot Test Modules interact with the Intel® Edge
Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) Command Line Interface (CLI)
through a common test module interface (TMI) layer which is part of the
Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) binary. Intel®
Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) generates a complete
test report in HTML format, along with detailed logs packaged as one zip
file, which you can manually choose to email to:
<edge.software.device.qualification@intel.com>. More detailed
information is available at [Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification
(Intel® ESDQ)
Overview](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/edge-software-device-qualification.html).

> **Note**:

```

Check the successful installation of the Intel® Edge Software Device
Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) CLI verifying that the execution of the
following command prints `Version: 11.0.0` on the terminal:

```bash
esdq --version
```

### 2. Download and Install the Test Modules

To download and install the Autonomous Mobile Robot test modules on your
target device follow the steps below:

1. Install the `ros-jazzy-amr-esdq` Deb package from Intel® Autonomous
   Mobile Robot APT repository.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-jazzy-amr-esdq
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-amr-esdq
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

2. The tests are conducted from the directory pointed by the previously
   set `ROBOTICS_SDK` variable. Copy the installed test suite into the
   directory.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   cp -r /opt/ros/jazzy/share/amr-esdq/AMR_Test_Module/ $ROBOTICS_SDK/modules/
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   cp -r /opt/ros/humble/share/amr-esdq/AMR_Test_Module/ $ROBOTICS_SDK/modules/
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

3. Verify the appropriate permissions for the test modules directory by
   executing the following command:

   ```bash
   cd $ROBOTICS_SDK
   chmod -R +xw  modules/AMR_Test_Module
   ```

4. Check that the Autonomous Mobile Robot test module is correctly
   installed by verifying that the output of the following command
   lists the `Robotics_SDK` module.

   ```bash
   esdq module list
   ```

5. Download the necessary assets required by the test suite.

   ```bash
   esdq --verbose module run Robotics_SDK --arg download
   ```

## Run the Self-Certification Application for Compute Systems

1. Use the `groups` command to verify whether the current user belongs
   to the `render`, `video`, and `dialout` groups. If the user does not
   belong to these groups, add the group membership:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G render,video,dialout $USER
   ```

   Log out and log in again.

2. If you have just installed the `ros-jazzy-amr-esdq` Deb package as
   described in the
   [installation](#download-and-install-intel-edge-software-device-qualification-intel-esdq-for-autonomous-mobile-robot)
   section, reboot your system.

   Otherwise, there is a possibility that the tests that depend on the
   [GPU ORB Extractor](../../dev_guide/tutorials_amr/perception/orb-extractor/index.rst)
   encounter issues accessing the GPU.

3. Make sure that the environment variable `ROBOTICS_SDK` is
   initialized as shown in the
   [installation](#download-and-install-intel-edge-software-device-qualification-intel-esdq-for-autonomous-mobile-robot)
   section and change the working directory:

   ```bash
   echo $ROBOTICS_SDK
   cd $ROBOTICS_SDK
   ```

4. If your system uses a Linux Kernel 6.7.5 or later, read the
   [GPU device is not detected with Linux Kernel 6.7.5 or later](../../dev_guide/tutorials_amr/robot-tutorials-troubleshooting.md).
   If your system is impacted by this issue, export the following debug
   variables as a workaround:

   ```bash
   export NEOReadDebugKeys=1
   export OverrideGpuAddressSpace=48
   ```

5. Run the Intel® Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ)
   test, and generate the report:

   ```bash
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   esdq --verbose module run Robotics_SDK
   ```

6. Visualize the report by opening the `reports/report.html` file in
   your browser.

## Run the Self-Certification Application for RGB Cameras

This self-certification test expects the camera stream to be on the
`/camera/color/image_raw` topic. This topic must be visible in rviz2
using the `camera_color_frame` fixed frame. If your camera
ROS 2 node does not stream to that topic by default, use ROS 2 remapping
to publish to that topic.

> **Note**:
>
> The following steps use the Intel® RealSense™ camera's ROS 2 node as an
> example. You must change the node to your actual camera's ROS 2 node.

You can check your current configuration by:

1. Running the RGB camera node in a ROS 2 environment after setting the
   `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   # set a unique id here that is used in all terminals
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py camera_namespace:=/ &
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   # set a unique id here that is used in all terminals
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py camera_namespace:=/ &
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

2. Verifying the presence of the topic in the topic list.

   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```

3. Once your configuration is set, you can proceed to run the Intel®
   Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) test and generate
   the report.

   ```bash
   cd $ROBOTICS_SDK
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   esdq --verbose module run Robotics_SDK --arg sensors_rgb
   ```

## Run the Self-Certification Application for Depth Cameras

This self-certification test expects the camera stream to be on the
`/camera/depth/color/points` and on the `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`
topics. These topics must be visible in rviz2 using the
`camera_link` fixed frame. If your camera ROS 2 node does
not stream to that topic by default, use ROS 2 remapping to publish to
that topic.

> **Note**: The following steps use the Intel® RealSense™ camera's ROS 2 node as an
> example. You must change the node to your actual camera's ROS 2 node.

You can check your current configuration by:

1. Running the depth camera node in a ROS 2 environment after setting
   the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   # set a unique id here that is used in all terminals
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true camera_namespace:=/ &
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   # set a unique id here that is used in all terminals
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true camera_namespace:=/ &
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

2. Verifying the presence of the topic in the topic list.

   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```

3. Once your configuration is set, you can proceed to run the Intel®
   Edge Software Device Qualification (Intel® ESDQ) test and generate
   the report.

   ```bash
   cd $ROBOTICS_SDK
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19
   esdq --verbose module run Robotics_SDK --arg sensors_depth
   ```

## Send Results to Intel

Once the automated and manual tests are executed successfully, you can
submit your test results and get your devices listed on the
[Intel® Edge Software Recommended Hardware](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/edge-solutions/hardware.html)
