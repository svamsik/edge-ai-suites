# How It Works

The Image-Based Video Search Application is a modular reference implementation
designed to help developers create vision-based search systems utilizing Vision
AI and third-party microservices. This page provides a technical overview of the
application’s architecture, components, and extensibility.

## Purpose

The Image-Based Video Search Application is designed to:

- Demonstrate how Vision AI and vector databases enable real-time image search
  in live video streams.
- Serve as a blueprint for building scalable, modular search systems.
- Showcase optimization techniques for Intel® hardware and software tools.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Input Sources**:

   - **Video File**: A video file as simulated camera input is fed into the
     system.
   - **User-provided images for search**: Allows users to upload images or for
     searching within the video streams.

2. **Video Analysis Pipeline**:

   - **Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server**:
     - Consumes RTSP streams for object detection and feature extraction.
     - Publishes metadata to an MQTT Broker.
   - **Feature Matching Microservice**:
     - Inserts extracted feature vectors (image embeddings) into MilvusDB
       (Vector DB).
     - Stores frames for display in search results.

3. **Video Search Pipeline**:

   - **Feature Matching Microservice**:
     - Queries DL Streamer Pipeline Server for feature vectors of user-provided
       images.
     - Searches MilvusDB to find matching frames.

4. **Output Generation**:

   - Displays matched frames and metadata in the web application.

## Key Components and Their Roles

1. **Nginx reverse proxy server**
   - **What it is**: An Nginx reverse proxy acts as an intermediary server that forwards client requests to backend servers, helping with load balancing, SSL termination, caching, and centralized access control.
   - **How it’s used**: It acts as proxy server. All interactions to IBVS app happens via nginx server. It forwards all the requests from outside world to internal services based on routing configuration.
   - **Benefits**: It acts as protective gateway that receives external requests and securely forwards them to internal services, keeping those backend apps hidden and inaccessible from direct external access.

1. **MediaMTX (Third-Party Microservice)**

   - **What it is**: A service that simulates remote video cameras.
   - **How it’s used**: Replays videos as RTSP/WebRTC streams for processing and
     display.
   - **Benefits**: Allows testing of video search features without physical
     cameras.

1. **DL Streamer Pipeline Server (Microservice for Feature Extraction)**

   - **What it is**: A microservice that processes video streams for object
     detection and feature extraction.
   - **How it’s used**: Converts RTSP streams into feature vectors and publishes
     metadata.
   - **Benefits**: Enables efficient AI-powered video analysis.

1. **Feature Matching Microservice**

   - **What it is**: A service that stores and retrieves feature vectors.
   - **How it's used**: Stores extracted embeddings in MilvusDB and retrieves
     matches during search.
   - **Benefits**: Supports real-time video search by matching image embeddings.

1. **MQTT Broker (Third-Party Microservice)**

   - **What it is**: A message broker for streaming metadata between services.
   - **How it’s used**: Transfers feature metadata between DL Streamer Pipeline
     Server and Feature Matching.
   - **Benefits**: Ensures smooth, real-time metadata communication.

1. **MilvusDB (Vector Database)**

   - **What it is**: A high-performance vector database.
   - **How it's used**: Stores feature vectors and provides a vector search
     interface.
   - **Benefits**: Enables fast and scalable image similarity search.

## Extensibility

The Image-Based Video Search Application is designed with modularity in mind,
allowing developers to:

1. **Add Input Sources**:

   - Example: Integrate real IP cameras for live video feeds.

1. **Enhance AI Pipelines**:

   - Example: Replace object detection models with custom AI models.

1. **Expand Database Capabilities**:

   - Example: Use alternative vector databases like FAISS or Pinecone.

1. **Scale Deployments**:

   - Example: Deploy on cloud infrastructure to support larger-scale searches.
